# Simple-Chat-Bot
ðŸš€ Simple Chat Bot in Python A beginner-friendly Python project that interacts with users, asks questions, guesses their age, and even tests their programming knowledge with a quiz. ðŸŽ¯

## Features
- Greets the user and asks for their name
- Guesses the user's age based on modular arithmetic
- Counts up to a user-defined number
- Conducts a simple multiple-choice quiz about programming
- Repeats the quiz until the correct answer is given

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Clone this repository or download the `chatbot.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Example Interaction
```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
> Kate
What a great name you have, Kate!

Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5, and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!

Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> 3
0 !
1 !
2 !
3 !

Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.
> 4
Please, try again.
> 2
Congratulations, have a nice day!
```

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** None (pure Python)

## Future Improvements
- Add more quiz questions and randomize them
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter or a web version with Flask
- Improve user input handling with better error messages
